# is v.s ==
# 'is' is for reference equality. Use it when you would like to know if two references refer to the same object.
# '==' is  for value equality. Use it when you would like to know if two objects have the same value.

(1)
>>> a = 500
>>> b = 500
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
False

(2)
>>> c = 200
>>> d = 200
>>> c == d

>>> c is d
True

Python caches integer objects in the range -5~256 as singleton instances for performance reasons.
