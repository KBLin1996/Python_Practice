# click.echo() v.s print() -> 1. echo() has no return value, print has return value (1)
#                             2. echo() can be called consecutively but print() can't
#                                Ex: echo('a')('b')('c')
#                             3. echo() is slightly faster than print()
#                             4. echo() does not exist in python (but click.echo does)
